"""
This file is provided as an example of what a simplistic controller could be done.
It simply uses the DataCollectionUI interface zo receive sensing_messages and send controls.

/!\ Be warned that if the processing time of NNMsgProcessor.process_message is superior to the message reception period, a lag between the images processed and commands sent.
One might want to only process the last sensing_message received, etc. 
Be warned that this could also cause crash on the client side if socket sending buffer overflows

/!\ Do not work directly in this file (make a copy and rename it) to prevent future pull from erasing what you write here.
